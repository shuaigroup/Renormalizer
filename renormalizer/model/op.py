class Op:
    r"""
    The operator class. The class can be considered as a symbolic way to express
    quantum operator such as :math:`a^\dagger_i a_j`, :math:`b^\dagger_i + b_i`
    or :math:`g \omega a^\dagger_i a_i (b^\dagger_{ij} + b_{ij})`.
    Multiplications between operators are supported.

    Parameters
    ----------
    symbol : str
        The string of the operator, such as ``"a"``, ``"a^\dagger a"`` and ``r"b^\dagger + b"``.
        The supported operators are defined in :class:`~renormalizer.model.basis.BasisSet`.
        For complex symbols consisting of multiplication of simple symbols,
        separate the simple symbols with a single space.
    dof : hashable object or :class:`list` of hashable objects.
        The name of the DoF related to the operator.
        For simple symbol such as ``"a"``, the type could be any hashable object.
        :class:`int`, :class:`str` and :class:`tuple` of them are recommended types for ``dof``.
        For complex symbol such as ``"a^\dagger a"``, the type should be a list of hashable objects,
        with each element representing one of the simple symbol contained in the complex symbol.
        Using a single hashable object is also supported for complex symbol,
        in which case every symbol is assumed to share the same DoF name.
    factor : :class:`float` or :class:`complex` or :class:`Quantity`
        The prefactor of the operator.
    qn : :class:`int` or :class:`list` of :class:`int`.
        The quantum number of the symbol. For simple symbol the ``qn`` should be an :class:`int`.
        For complex symbol quantum number of each simple symbol contained in the complex symbol
        should be provided. If ``qn`` is set to `None`, then the quantum number for every symbol is set to 0
        except for``"a^\dagger"`` and ``"a"``, whose quantum number are set to 1 and -1 respectively.

    Notes
    =====
    Symbols connected by plus ``"+"`` such as ``r"b^\dagger + b"`` is considered as a simple symbol,
    because this class is designed to deal with operator multiplication rather than addition.

    Warnings
    ========
    If you wish to specify the DoF of each symbol in a complex symbol,
    you should use a :class:`list` instead of :class:`tuple`.
    Because in the latter case the :class:`tuple` is recognized as a single DoF
    and the DoFs of all simple symbols are set to the :class:`tuple`.
