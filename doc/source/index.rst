Welcome to Renormalizer's documentation!
========================================
Renormalizer is a quantum dynamics package based on density matrix
renormalization group (DMRG) and its time dependent formulation written in
Python. All (TD-)DMRG algorithms are implemented within the framework of matrix
product states (MPS) and matrix product operators (MPO). The package aims to
provide a light-weight and efficient platform for quantum dynamics simulation
and method development with (TD-)DMRG.
The package is still under heavy development. Please refer to our recent papers
for the new developments.
