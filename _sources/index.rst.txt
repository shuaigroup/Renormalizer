Welcome to Renormalizer's documentation!
========================================
Renormalizer is a Python based tensor network package with a special focus on electron-phonon quantum dynamics.
It is originally developed based on matrix product states (MPS) and matrix product operators (MPO)
and thus the algorithms are called (TD-)DMRG.
In 2024 tree tensor network states (TTNS) and tree tensor network operators (TTNO) utilities are implemented.
Renormalizer can routinely perform quantum dynamics calculation involving hundreds to thousands of degrees of freedom
in a numerically exact manner, sometimes using only a single CPU core.

Renormalizer is developed by `Prof. Zhigang Shuai's group <http://www.shuaigroup.net/index.php>`_.
Its source code is hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/shuaigroup/Renormalizer>`_.
